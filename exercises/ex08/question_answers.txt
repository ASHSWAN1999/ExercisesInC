1.) GLib is written by GNOME. Its purpose is to provide data structures in C.
Originally, it was a part of GTK, but was made into a seprate library because
the data structure functionality could be used outside of GUI programming.
A different name definitely would have been beneficial because, in researching
library, everything came up with glibc, and there was no good way to comb out
the information I was actually looking for.

2.) A pro of using GLib rather than base C functionality is that you don't have
to reinvent the wheel each time you need a given data structure. However, the
upfront time cost of downloading and understanding the standards of this library
are an obvious con. Compared to other similar programs, there does not seem
to be a clear winner on which is the best data structure library, introducing
the potential to spend lots of time figuring out the conventions of multiple
libraries rather than know which to use out of the gate.

3.) To compile a program using GLib, you  need a compliant C toolchain, Meson, 
and pkg-config.
